# ytmp3

> Download Youtube videos and convert them to MP3

## Installation

```console
 $ curl -fsSL git.io/ytmp3 | sh
```

All this installation script does is download the `ytmp3` script, make it an executable, and copy it to your `$PATH (/usr/local/bin)`. For copying to your `$PATH`, it may be required to enter your password. If there is a better way to do this, please send in a pull request.

`ytmp3` relies solely on `youtube-dl` and `ffmpeg` - if you don't already have it installed this script itself will install them for you. Otherwise just paste the following into the terminal:

```console
 $ brew install youtube-dl ffmpeg
```

## Usage

```console
  Usage:
    ytmp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9TpRfDdyU0
    ytmp3 [options]

  Options:
    -V, --version    Output version
